### Hi! I'm James Diefenbach
I'm a second-year student completing a double degree in computer science and neuroscience at UNSW. As a generalist, I have worked on several small hobby projects in diverse areas from 3D modelling to game development, demonstrating my interest and ability in problem-solving, and solution design & development.

As someone who is particularly fascinated by the intersections of data and neuroscience, I'm eager to explore the myriad applications of this field! I'm currently looking for opportunities to gain hands-on experience and apply my skills, knowledge and passion
