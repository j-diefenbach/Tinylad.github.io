# COMP1531: Software Engineering
## Summary
Software engineering principles via exposure to the important practice of building correct products in effectively functioning teams.

Exposed to agile software practices, team collaboration and effective communication. Required to analyse, design, build and deploy a web-based application. 
## Assesment
### Labs
### Major Group Project
* Group Project, developing a JS (converted to TypeScript) backend, running a web-based application for messages
* Black-box testing, extensive test suites using jest
* Use of git, gitlab (feature-branches, merge-requests etc.)
* Teamwork, collaboration (task board, standups, meetings etc.)
### Individual Project Iteration
## Outcomes
1. Demonstrate effective use of software development tools to build full-stack end-user applications
2. Demonstrate effective use of static testing, dynamic testing, and user testing to validate and verify software systems
3. Understand key characteristics of a functioning team in terms of understanding professional expectations, maintaining healthy relationships, and managing conflict.
4. Demonstrate an ability to analyse complex software systems in terms of their data model, state model, and more.
5. Understand the software engineering life cycle in the context of modern and iterative software development practices in order to elicit requirements, design systems thoughtfully, and implement software correctly.
6. Demonstrate an understanding of how to use version control, continuous integration, and deployment tooling to sustainably integrate code from multiple parties
