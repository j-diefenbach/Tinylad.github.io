# Molecules, Cells and Genes
## Summary
The course is concerned with the basic characteristics of all life. The chemistry of life is examined, with emphasis on the ways in which living things construct and break down macromolecules. The way in which the genetic code controls these processes depends to a great extent on the structure and function of cell components, and cell biology is a major component of the course. The final topic is genetics - the way in which the genetic code is inherited and the ways in which it can be modified.

## Outcomes
1. Effectively communicate scientific findings to different audiences using different methods;
2. Identify different types of cells, their structures and functions, and compare and contrast them;
3. Outline the processes for energy generation in cells, including the structure and roles of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids; and,
4. Describe the structures of genetic material, the processes involved in cell division and gene expression, and how these relate to inheritance.
