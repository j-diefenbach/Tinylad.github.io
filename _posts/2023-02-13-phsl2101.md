# Physiology 1A
## Summary
Introduction to fundamental physiological principles, from basic cellular function in
terms of chemical and physical principles to the operation and interaction of body systems. Although
introductory in the level of content, this course in Human Physiology is comprehensive in scope covering
a range of body systems from a cellular to a more integrative approach. For example, the
sequence of ion permeability changes in membranes that can result in the initiation and propagation of
a nerve impulse along a nerve fibre, as well as more complex interactions between whole organ systems.

The major areas of study include cell *physiology*, *muscle*, *the cardiovascular system*, *blood* and
*neurophysiology*. It should also be noted that, where appropriate, subject areas are treated quantitatively
as well as qualitatively, an approach that requires students to have at least a basic knowledge of
mathematics and chemistry
## Outcomes
1. demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the function of the
individual body systems covered, which include excitable tissues, muscle, blood and the
cardiovascular system, and the nervous system.
2. clearly and concisely describe the basic physiological mechanisms responsible for how our body
mediates cell communication and/or maintains homeostasis as related to muscle, blood, the
cardiovascular and nervous systems.
3. develop basic skills in experimental physiology with a fo
